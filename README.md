## ✨ What is Wakey Wakey?

**Wakey Wakey** is a sleek, browser-based app designed to **keep your computer awake** — whether you're downloading something big, watching a long video, or simply taking a snack break during work.

It's powered by the **Wake Lock API**, styled like a glowing filament lightbulb, and built to work **with zero setup** — just toggle it on and leave the tab open. That’s it.

## 📖 Backstory: Why I Built This

> _"As an intern working the graveyard shift, I found myself constantly interrupted — my laptop would sleep every 5 minutes. I didn’t have admin rights to change settings. Frustrated, I created Wakey Wakey — a simple solution that kept my screen alive while I took short breaks or grabbed coffee."_

This project became more than just a workaround — it became a little productivity hack, handcrafted for people like me... and maybe like you.
