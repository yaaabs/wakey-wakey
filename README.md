## 🧠 Why I Built This

While working late-night shifts during my internship, I discovered that my laptop would frequently fall asleep — disconnecting my VPN and interrupting my workflow. Without the ability to modify system settings, I built **Wakey Wakey** as a lightweight, web-based alternative to keep my screen awake without hassle.

> _This app provides a clean and hassle-free solution for preventing your screen from locking or sleeping. Just toggle it on and let it run in the background — no installs, no extensions._
