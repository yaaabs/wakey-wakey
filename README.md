## 🌟 Overview

**Wakey Wakey** is a minimal, dark-themed web app that uses the Wake Lock API to prevent your device from sleeping or locking. It's perfect for:
- Watching long videos
- Running downloads
- Presenting slides
- Working with unstable VPN connections

## 👨‍💻 Why I Built This

During my internship, I often worked night shifts using a company-issued laptop. I couldn’t adjust sleep settings, and my VPN would randomly disconnect when the screen locked. Instead of relying on third-party tools, I built **Wakey Wakey** to solve the problem cleanly and efficiently using the Wake Lock API — now it’s a tool I use daily, and others can too.

> _Whatever your reason, Wakey Wakey provides a simple and hassle-free way to prevent your computer from locking or sleeping. Just click the button and focus on your task — no interruptions._
